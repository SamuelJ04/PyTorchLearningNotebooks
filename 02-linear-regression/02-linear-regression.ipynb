What is a linear regression model? Give an example of a problem formulated as a linear regression model.\n","\n","A linear regression model basically tries to map a set of numbers to a linear curve, an example is just having numbers for temperature and rainfall and having a yield\n","It's commonly used if you have inputs and targets that are numerical values.\n","\n","2. What are input and target variables in a dataset? Give an example.\n","\n","inputs are the inputs you have like the data over an environment\n","targets are the things you're trying to achieve\n","\n","\n","3. What are weights and biases in a linear regression model?\n","\n","basically you can express the target output as a linear combination of the inputs multiplied by a weights matrix and addint an offset bias vector.\n","\n","4. How do you represent tabular data using PyTorch tensors?\n","\n","you load them into a numpy array and then convert that into a tensor\n","\n","5. Why do we create separate matrices for inputs and targets while training a linear regression model?\n","\n","that's kind of intuitive, inputs are inputs and the targets are what you're tyring to acheive\n","in machine learning you're letting the model determine the rules to figure out the targets\n","\n","6. How do you determine the shape of the weights matrix & bias vector given some training data?\n","\n","the bias vector is as big as the number of targets you may have\n","like in our equation there are two targets, meaning that there are two linear equations\n","\n","the weights matrix has the number of rows (= number of targets) by the number of inputs \n","so if you have two targets and 3 inputs the weights matrix is 2x3 \n","\n","however we need to transpose the matrix to you know make the multiplicaiotn possible because \n","\n","mxn mxn where the internam n and m have to be the same for matrix multiplication to occur\n","\n","\n","7. How do you create randomly initialized weights & biases with a given shape?\n","\n","uhhh you use a random generator \n","w = torch.randn(2, 3, requires_grad=True)\n","b = torch.randn(2, requires_grad=True)\n","print(w)\n","print(b)\n","\n","or you can use model = nn.Linear while including the parameters to fill it\n","\n","8. How is a linear regression model implemented using matrix operations? Explain with an example.\n","\n","Ax + b = target \n","\n","more specifically \n","Inputs w^T + b = target vector\n","\n","then we do a little multivariate calculus\n","\n","9. How do you generate predictions using a linear regression model?\n","\n","lol you just put some inputs into the matrix equation and then you're golden.\n","\n","10. Why are the predictions of a randomly initialized model different from the actual targets?\n","\n","because they are randomly generated weights, we're trying to train a model to descend and figure out the weights and biases that are correct\n","\n","you're just plugging in random weights and biases i mean it could work but it's not going to work\n","\n","11. What is a loss function? What does the term “loss” signify?\n","\n","a loss function basically helps determine how different the values are from what they're supposed to be \n","\n","12. What is mean squared error?\n","\n","a mean squared error is you sum all the differences squared and divide them by the number of objects\n","the reason why it's often squared is that you don't have negative numbers in your loss\n","\n","13. Write a function to calculate mean squared using model predictions and actual targets.\n","\n","def mse(t1,t2):\n","    diff = t1-t2\n","    return torch.sum(diff * diff) / diff.numel()\n","\n","\n","\n","14. What happens when you invoke the `.backward` function on the result of the mean squared error loss function?\n","\n","takes the backwards derivatives of the loss function wrt to w and b because we set requires_grad equal to true for those values\n","so that the derivatves thave \n","\n","15. Why is the derivative of the loss w.r.t. the weights matrix itself a matrix? What do its elements represent?\n","\n","its a matrix because the weights are a matrix. each element changes wrt to the loss fucntion differently and they need to be adjusted in different ways\n","\n","16. How is the derivate of the loss w.r.t. a weight element useful for reducing the loss? Explain with an example.\n","\n","basically it tells you if increasing or decreasing the value of the weights increases or decreses the loss. then you can adjust accordingly to decrease the loss\n","\n","17. Suppose the derivative  of the loss w.r.t. a weight element is positive. Should you increase or decrease the element’s value slightly to get a lower loss?\n","\n","if the derivative of the loss w.r.t a weight element is positive the element's value then you should decrease the element's value to get a lower loss\n","\n","18. Suppose the derivative  of the loss w.r.t. a weight element is negative. Should you increase or decrease the element’s value slightly to get a lower loss?\n","\n","if the derivative of the loss w.r.t a weight element is negative, then you should increase the element's value to get a lower loss.\n","\n","19. How do you update the weights and biases of a model using their respective gradients to reduce the loss slightly?\n","\n","you just subtract a 1e-5 * w.grad example becuase the gradients can be big or small so just adjust in very small steps\n","works for the negative case because subtracting a negative actually adds the number as an adjusstment.\n","\n","20. What is the gradient descent optimization algorithm? Why is it called “gradient descent”?\n","\n","using the gradient to adjust the loss and optimizaiton. it's called the gradient descent because you're taking the gradient until you get a plateau or saddle point to achieve optimization.\n","you're adjusting it until the steepest ascent is zero.\n","\n","21. Why do you subtract a “small quantity” proportional to the gradient from the weights & biases, not the actual gradient itself?\n","\n","because the gradient is the point of steepest ascent, the rate at which something is changinging, you don't want to make a large cut and end up in a tick tock clock corrupted pendulum motion.\n","do not want to take a step that is too big\n","\n","22. What is learning rate? Why is it important?\n","\n","learning rate is the rate at which it's actually improving, you don't want an algorithm that is incredibly slow at learning with bonkers matrix multiplication.\n","\n","23. What is `torch.no_grad`?\n","\n","indicates that the gradient is not being calcualted at the time and temporarily sets all the requires_grad flages to false , saves memeory nad computation \n","used for adjusting due to the gradients of the loss wrt of w and b.\n","\n","24. Why do you reset gradients to zero after updating weights and biases?\n","\n","because if you don't the new gradient calculation adds to the gradient vector and that is very bad so you reset it to zero every time.\n","\n","25. What are the steps involved in training a linear regression model using gradient descent?\n","\n","a. generate random weights and biases. \n","b. define loss function\n","c. calculate backwards derivatives of loss funciotn with respect to weights and biases\n","d. adjust weights and biases with a small increment then reset each gradient back to zero.\n","e. repeat\n","\n","26. What is an epoch?\n","\n","the iteration counter of how many times you're optimizing the model using a backwards gradient descent\n","\n","27. What is the benefit of training a model for multiple epochs?\n","\n","the model gets more optimized per each iteration\n","\n","28. How do you make predictions using a trained model?\n","\n","same way you make predictions using an untrained model, you just plug inputs into the model\n","\n","29. What should you do if your model’s loss doesn’t decrease while training? Hint: learning rate.\n","\n","you're either taking too large of seteps per epoch or you've done so many epochs that you're plateauing\n","\n","30. What is `torch.nn`?\n","\n","its the PyTorch neural netork library\n","\n","31. What is the purpose of the `TensorDataset` class in PyTorch? Give an example.\n","\n","the TensorDataset class in PyTorch is used to segmenet our dataset into smaller parts\n","\n","32. What is a data loader in PyTorch? Give an example.\n","\n","a dataloader can load in specific bastches of data\n","\n","33. How do you use a data loader to retrieve batches of data?\n","\n","batch_size = 5\n","train_dl = DataLoader(train_ds, batch_size, shuffle=True)\n","\n","you ust use the training dataset with a batch side and suffle\n","\n","34. What are the benefits of shuffling the training data before creating batches?\n","\n","don't have adjacent and similar values next to each other like if you have something alphabetized in the dataset it's best to train off\n","of random packets to get the quickest results\n","\n","35. What is the benefit of training in small batches instead of training with the entire dataset?\n","\n","can only have so much stored in memory at the same time.\n","\n","36. What is the purpose of the `nn.Linear` class in PyTorch? Give an example.\n","\n","the nn.linear class is a basic linear regression model.\n","\n","37. How do you see the weights and biases of a `nn.Linear` model?\n","\n","you callmodel = nn.Linear(3, 2)\n","print(model.weight)\n","print(model.bias)\n","\n","or you do list(model.parameters()) or print that \n","\n","38. What is the purpose of the `torch.nn.functional` module?\n","\n","torch.nn.functional module has loss fucntions \n","\n","39. How do you compute mean squared error loss using a PyTorch built-in function?\n","\n","you import torch.nn.functional as Floss_fn = F.mse_loss\n","loss = loss_fn(model(inputs), targets)\n","print(loss)\n","\n","40. What is an optimizer in PyTorch?\n","\n","an optimizer takes the loss and minimizes the orginal factors to optimize the weights and biases\n","\n","41. What is `torch.optim.SGD`? What does SGD stand for?\n","\n","stochastic gradient descent\n","adjusts based on a gradient descent algorithm\n","\n","42. What are the inputs to a PyTorch optimizer? \n","\n","you just need the model's parameters and then the factor of adjustment\n","\n","43. Give an example of creating an optimizer for training a linear regression model.\n","\n","opt = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)\n","            # 3. Compute gradients, updates them from zero\n","            loss.backward()\n","            \n","            # 4.
